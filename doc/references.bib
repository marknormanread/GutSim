abstract = {Basic bacterial physiology predicts that the element composition of cells changes as a function of generation time. Rapidly growing cells are characterized by low C:P and N:P ratios compared to ratios of slowly growing cells. Working from this premise, we (1) determined the element composition of newly synthesized bacteria collected from an oligotrophic Canadian shield lake and (2) compared the changes in element composition of bacteria to their temporal changes in abundance. The element composition of new biomass was determined from the change in bacterial element composition following nutrient enrichment and incubation with nutrients derived from seston concentrated from a eutrophic lake. Bacterial C:P and C:N ratios generally decreased during incubation but N:P ratios changed only slightly. When averaged, new bacterial biomass had a C:P ratio (atomic) of 44.4, N:P of 8.5, and C:N of 5.5 (C:N:P 44:9:1). The element composition of the in situ bacterial assemblage of an oligotrophic lake was compared to the temporal dynamics of the assemblage. Cell N:P and C:P ratios were low when cell abundance was increasing compared to the ratios obtained following a rapid decline in cell abundance. The data indicate that bacteria may alter their cellular element composition, and that the growth dynamics of bacterial assemblages may be reflected by the element ratios of their biomass.},

abstract = {The digestion and absorption of dietary starch and nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) in the small intestine of man from oats, cornflakes, and white bread has been determined by feeding seven ileostomists test meals containing these foods and estimating carbohydrate recovery in the effluent. NSP, the main constituent of dietary fiber, was almost completely recovered from all three test meals, including the water soluble beta-glucan which is the main NSP in oats. Less than 0.6{\%} of the starch in oats was recovered as starch with a further 1.2{\%} as dextrins and maltose. 4{\%} of cornflake starch however was recovered, of which the main part was resistant to alpha-amylase digestion in vitro unless specially dispersed. Similarly with white bread 2.5{\%} of ingested starch reached the terminal ileum of which the greater part was starch resistant to alpha-amylase in vitro. Overall 5.8{\%} of the carbohydrate in white bread, 5.3{\%} in cornflakes, and 11.7{\%} in oats was recovered. This study supports the view that human digestive enzymes do not break down dietary NSP. It also identifies a fraction of starch, RS, present in processed food which resists breakdown by alpha-amylase both in vitro and in the small intestine of man.},

Starch content of bananas depended on the ripeness being 37{\%} of dry weight in the least ripe and 3{\%} in the most ripe. Excretion of carbohydrate from banana in ileostomy effluent ranged from 4-19 g/day and was directly related to the starch content (r = 0.99). Up to 90{\%} of the starch could be accounted for in the effluent. Complete recovery of nonstarch polysaccharides [NSP (dietary fiber)] was obtained. The amount of banana starch not hydrolyzed and absorbed from the human small intestine and therefore passing into the colon may be up to 8 times more than the NSP present in this food and depends on the state of ripeness when the fruit is eaten.},

Using a carbon content of 0.53 g/g in protein and of 0.44 g/g in carbohydrate, the concentrations of normal proteins, proteins containing chromophoric groups, and proteins containing carbohydrate could be established. The method appeared to be independent of the nature of the protein and showed complete linearity between 25 and 1000 mg/l (0.5-20 micrograms per assay) when protein was serially diluted. Determination of specific absorption coefficients by measuring both the absorbance of protein solutions at 280 nm and their carbon concentrations gave values which, on the average, coincided within 12{\%} with values reported in the literature. The method may have special applicability in protein purification studies, as it does not require knowledge of molar extinction coefficients beforehand, and also monitors the disappearance of carbon compounds other than protein.},

@article{Silvester1995,
abstract = {An association between meat eating and large bowel cancer risk has been shown in a variety of epidemiologic studies. One reason could be that meat is less well digested than other protein foods and leads to greater amounts of protein entering the large bowel and being metabolized by colonic bacteria to potential carcinogens. To test this hypothesis, five subjects with ileostomies were fed, for five days a basal diet to which were added test meals of cheese, a small or a large fried beef steak, and a large steak with resistant starch (RS). Ileal true nitrogen digestibility was similar for all five diets: control, 86.3{\%}; cheese, 89.4{\%}; low beef; 88.6{\%}; high beef; 89.6{\%}; and high beef + RS, 88.7{\%}. Beef; at bath low and high intake levels, was as well digested as cheese, suggesting that poor digestibility of meat does not explain the association between meat intake and large bowel cancer risk. Ileal starch output on the high beef + RS diet was 27{\%} greater than expected on the basis of the measurement of dietary RS in vitro (p = 0.002). Ileal nitrogen output was strongly related to the amount of dietary nitrogen (p = 0.005 for linear trend), and this was confirmed by a meta analysis with eight other published studies. The relation between meat and large bowel cancer may reflect higher protein intakes in meat eaters or may be explained by other mechanisms.},

abstract = {Six subjects with ileostomies consumed five diets containing 61-164 g starch/d of which 0.4-34.8 g was resistant starch (RS). Ileal excretion of starch was 97{\%} of that measured as dietary RS in vitro with no significant difference between RS fed and starch recovered on any of the test diets. Variation in starch excretion between subjects was partly due to differences in mouth-to-stoma transit time. In vitro fermentation of ileal effluent from RS-supplemented diets produced significantly more short-chain fatty acids, a higher molar proportion of butyrate (17{\%} compared with 12{\%}), and a lower concentration of ammonia compared with control subjects. These results indicate that the amount of starch that reaches the large intestine can be predicted from measurements in vitro for a wide range of RS intakes under normal eating conditions. They also support the hypothesis that RS, through fermentation, has distinctive influences on the colonic environment.},

Samples were taken from the cultures at both the exponential and stationary phases. The elemental composition of individual bacterial cells was analyzed by X-ray microanalysis with an electron microscope. The cell size was also measured. The elemental content was highest in exponentially growing cells (149 +/- 8 fg of C cell(-1), 35 +/- 2 fg of N cell(-1), and 12 1 fg of P cell(-1); average of all isolates standard error). The lowest C content was found in C-limited cells (39 3 fg of C cell(-1)), the lowest N content in C- and P-limited cells (12 +/- 1 and 12 +/- 2 fg of N cell(-1), respectively), and the lowest P content in P-limited cells (2.3 +/- 0.6 fg of P cell(-1)). The atomic C:N ratios varied among treatments between 3.8 +/- 0.1 and 9.5 +/- 1.0 (average standard error), the C:P ratios between 35 +/- 2 and 178 +/- 28, and the N:P ratios between 6.7 +/- 0.3 and 18 +/- 3. The carbon-volume ratios showed large variation among isolates due to different types of nutrient limitation (from 51 4 to 241 38 fg of C mum(-1); average of individual isolates and treatments standard error). The results show that different growth conditions and differences in the bacterial community may explain some of the variability of previously reported elemental and carbon-volume ratios.},
